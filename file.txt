I can   handle projects like:
✔ Building AWS Infra(done)
VPC, subnets, NAT, IGW, EC2, ALB, ASG, RDS

                     ✔ Deploying Kubernetes
                    EKS nodes, Fargate, cluster autoscaler
                    
✔ Creating CI/CD Pipeline
Terraform Plan → Terraform Apply → Deploy App

✔ Creating Multi‑Environment Infra (done)
dev → stage → prod with workspaces or modules

✔ Using Terraform Backend (done)
S3 + DynamoDB / Azure Storage for state

🌐 Types of Websites / Applications & What Tools They Use
Below are the 4 common types of modern applications, what tools they use, and why.

1️⃣ Small Static Website
Examples:

Portfolio website
Company landing page
Simple blog

🔧 Tools Used

























NeedToolHostingS3, Azure Static Web App, NetlifyNo backendNo Docker, no KubernetesNo infra codeNo Terraform requiredOptional CI/CDGitHub Actions
💡 How project works:

Developer writes HTML/CSS/JS
Push to Git
CI/CD deploys it to S3/Static Web Apps

❌ No need for Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform

2️⃣ Medium Website (API + DB)
Examples:

Small e-commerce
College project
CRM website

🔧 Tools Used





























NeedToolBackend hostingEC2 / Azure VMDatabaseRDS / MySQLSmall automationTerraform (optional)PackagingDocker (optional)CI/CDGitHub Actions / Azure DevOps
💡 How project works:

Docker used to containerize the app
Terraform creates EC2 + Database
CI/CD deploys Docker container to VM

❌ Kubernetes not needed here
✔ Terraform + Docker is enough

3️⃣ Large Website / Microservices
Examples:

Zomato
Swiggy
Netflix
Amazon

🔧 Tools Used

































NeedToolContainer platformDockerContainer orchestrationKubernetes (K8s)Infrastructure provisioningTerraformSecrets managementVault / KMSCI/CDAzure DevOps / GitHub Actions / JenkinsMonitoringPrometheus / Grafana
💡 Why so many tools required?
🟩 Docker → Packages each microservice
Examples: order service, restaurant service, payment service
🟦 Kubernetes → Runs & manages those containers

Auto-healing
Load balancing
Auto-scaling
Zero downtime deployments

🟧 Terraform → Creates the infra

VPC
EKS / AKS / GKE
Databases (RDS)
Load balancers
Network security

🟨 CI/CD → Automates deployment

Build Docker image
Push to registry
Apply Terraform
Deploy to Kubernetes


🏗 How a Large Project Actually Works (Real Zomato Example)
Here’s the full flow in a simple diagram:
Developer 
    ↓
Writes code → pushes to GitHub/Azure Repo
    ↓
CI Pipeline
    - Build Docker image
    - Run tests
    - Push image to registry (ECR/ACR)
    ↓
Terraform
    - Creates Kubernetes cluster
    - Creates VPC, subnets, RDS, LB
    ↓
Kubernetes
    - Pulls Docker image
    - Runs pods
    - Scales automatically
    ↓
User accesses application


4️⃣ High Traffic, Global Applications
Examples:

Instagram
YouTube
Flipkart on Big Billion Day

🔧 Tools Used (Advanced)

Docker
Kubernetes
Terraform
Service Mesh (Istio)
API Gateway
Global CDN
Auto-scaling groups
Multi-region deployments

These apps need:

Massive scaling
Multi-region failover
Automatic deployments
24/7 uptime

So all modern DevOps tools become necessary.

🎯 In Summary — Why These Tools Are Needed





























ToolWhy NeededDockerPackages apps into containers so they run anywhereKubernetesManages 100s–1000s of containers automaticallyTerraformCreates infrastructure using code, no manual workCI/CDAutomates build, test, deploy for fast releasesCloud (AWS/Azure)Provides servers, DBs, networking
They are not duplicate tools → each has a unique purpose.
